# How to develop on this project

`PyDala` welcomes contributions from the community.

> **You need `PYTHON3` and `poetry`!**#<br>
> This instructions are for linux base systems. (Linux, MacOS, BSD, etc.)

## Setting up your own fork of this repo.

- On github interface click on `Fork` button.
- Clone your fork of this repo. `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GIT_USERNAME>/pydala.git`
- Enter the directory `cd pydala`
- Add upstream repo `git remote add upstream https://github.com/legout/pydala`

## Setting up your own virtual environment

Run `make dev-environment` to setup your development environment. This will install and configure `poetry`, as well as create a virtual environment in `.venv` and let `poetry` install all package / development dependencies and the project itself in development mode.

## Show the project current development environment

Run `make show` to get an overview about the current virtual environment. Which will give you something like:

```bash
Current environment:

Virtualenv
Python:         3.10.8
Implementation: CPython
Path:           /Users/<user>/<repo-path>/.venv
Valid:          True

System
Platform: darwin
OS:       posix
Python:   /usr/local/opt/<python-path>
```

## Run the tests to ensure everything is working

## Making a new release

This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and tags releases with `X.Y.Z`
Every time a new tag is created and pushed to the remote repo, github actions will
automatically create a new release on github and trigger a release on PyPI.

For this to work you need to setup a secret called `PIPY_API_TOKEN` on the project settings>secrets,
this token can be generated on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/account/).

To trigger a new release all you need to do is.

1. If you have changes to add to the repo
    * Make your changes following the steps described above.
    * Commit your changes following the [conventional git commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
2. Run the tests to ensure everything is working.
4. Run `make release` to create a new tag and push it to the remote repo.

the `make release` will ask you the version number to create the tag, ex: type `0.1.1` when you are asked.

> **CAUTION**:  The make release will change local changelog files and commit all the unstaged changes you have.
